## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Data Consistency Pattern
The application implements an **Exercise Snapshot Pattern** to ensure historical accuracy:

1. **Workout Creation**: When users complete workouts, exercise data is captured as immutable snapshots
2. **Historical Preservation**: Workout logs always show exercise data as it was at workout time
3. **Admin Flexibility**: Administrators can update exercises without affecting historical records
4. **Data Integrity**: Soft deletes and audit trails prevent data corruption

### Service Layer
- **ExerciseSnapshotService**: Manages exercise snapshots and historical data
- **ExerciseUpdateService**: Handles exercise updates with audit trails
- **RealTimeUpdateService**: Manages notifications and cache invalidation
- **WorkoutDataMigration**: Automated data migration and validation

## üîê Authentication & Security

### Features
- **Role-based Access Control**: USER and ADMIN roles with different permissions
- **Route Protection**: Middleware-level authentication for all protected routes
- **Component Guards**: Authentication checks at component level
- **API Security**: All endpoints validate user sessions
- **Admin Protection**: Admin-only routes require elevated permissions

### User Roles
- **USER**: Can create workouts, manage custom exercises, view history
- **ADMIN**: All user permissions plus exercise management and schedule control

## üìä Data Migration

The application includes a comprehensive migration system for converting existing data to the snapshot pattern:

### Migration Features
- **Automated Conversion**: Converts existing workout data to use snapshots
- **Data Validation**: Ensures migration integrity and completeness
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of data inconsistencies
- **Rollback Support**: Ability to rollback migrations for testing
- **Progress Reporting**: Detailed migration progress and results
